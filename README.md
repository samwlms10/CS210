1-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project that I uploaded was a program that reads a .txt document and makes a map and a .doc document for backup.  It then can output how many times a certain item appears either in an int form or in the form of a histogram.

2-What did you do particularly well?
I feel like I finally got the hang of OOP and my code is uniformed and easier to follow.  Every input has an input validation and the main program has the least amount of code in it.

3-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I do feel like some of my code isn't the most efficient with in regards to syntax and shorter simpler ways to write these things that I want to do with the program.  I believe learning more on this journey will make me a more efficient coder and make sure that my code will always be secure by finding new ways to prevent and security bugs.

4-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
For me the most challenging part was working with the maps because I have never coded with a map before and not knowing how to add things to it or cycle through it with a for loop was difficult.  To overcome this I was doing research watching YouTube videos and getting help from Stackoverflow also when I was stuck.

5-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
I think a lot of skills from continuing to improve my OOP skills, to learning more skills along the line of data storage such as maps, to even just continuing to code to have that repetition so I can remember things easier.

6-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make it maintainable I tried to name all the variables closely to what they actually will be needed for.  I wrote inline comments as well.  To make it readable I tried to make sure the spacing was consistent.  It is adaptable because everything is put into classes and easily labeled for what they do.
